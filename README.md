# Large-Scale Hospital Network Simulation

## Overview
This project presents a large-scale hospital network design simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The network is segmented by departments using VLANs and supports secure, scalable communication.

## Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN, IP Subnetting
- Static/Dynamic Routing
- Wireshark (traffic analysis)

## Project Structure
- BTL2_demo.spkt/ # Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file
- MMT_ASSIGNMENT_2/ # Project report (PDF)


## How to Open the Simulation
1. Install **Cisco Packet Tracer**
2. Open the file:
BTL2_demo.spkt


## Key Features
- Multi-department VLAN segmentation
- IP addressing and subnet planning
- Router and switch configuration
- Traffic flow verification
